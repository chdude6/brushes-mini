    <p><strong>Last Updated: [Date]</strong></p>

    <p>At Brushes, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle and protect your personal information while using our web-based image editor.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">1. Data We Do Not Collect</h3>
    <p>We do <span class="highlight">not collect</span> or store any personal information or images you create while using the Service. We do not save any of your data on our servers, and we do not track or share your data with third parties.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">2. Cookies and User Consent</h3>
    <p>While we do not collect personal data, we use <span class="highlight">cookies</span> to store temporary data such as drafts, preferences, and session data, which are <span class="highlight">only stored in your browser</span> for the duration of your session.
